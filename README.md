=======================================

## Background

No Thanks! is a card game for two to five player, played with a deck of
33 cards numbered from 3 through to 35.
At the start of the game each player has no cards and 11 tokens, and
5 cards are discarded from the deck (without being revealed).

## Goal

The aim of this is to have a 'simulator' for the game No Thanks!, that
will take arbitrary strategy functions, allowing me to test competing
strategies.
